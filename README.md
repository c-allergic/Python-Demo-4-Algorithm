# Python Demo for Algo.

## Code
- Linear Regression demo
- Ridge Regression demo
- Gradient Descent demo
- Logistic Regression demo: Interesting one and a lot to deal with.
- Differential Privacy demo: path to the directory and run `python main.py`. Be careful about the dependencies.
- Support vector Machine demo: Include complete pipeline and prediction code, could use AI to help generate client.
- Multi Layer Perceptron demo: California housing price prediction, build the simple NN with keras. 
  I try to drop some seemed irrelevant feature columns and the performance improve. Next time I'll learn how to get information from the data visualization.
